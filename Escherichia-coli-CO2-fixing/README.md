# *Escherichia coli K12* CO<sub>2</sub> fixing strain

The RBA model of the *Escherichia coli* CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing strain was generated using the RBApy package (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.06.001) 
from the *iJO1366* metabolic reconstruction (https://doi.org/10.1038/msb.2011.65) as descibed in
(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2019.06.001), by introducing modifications to the wild type as described in (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.05.064).
